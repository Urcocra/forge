# ESG Evaluation Report

**Framework:** FORGE  |  **Scope:** Evaluation-Time Sustainability & Governance  |  **Version:** v1.0  |  **Status:** Reproducible / Deterministic / Non-Comparative

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This ESG report documents the **environmental, social, and governance (ESG)** characteristics of a model evaluation run under the FORGE framework.

The ESG score reported here is:
- **Evaluation-time only** (no training, no fine-tuning)
- **Double-anchored** to *token usage* and *model parameter scale*
- **Orthogonal to task quality scores**
- **Deterministically reproducible**

This report is designed for **auditability**, **methodological transparency**, and **non-gamable disclosure**.

## 2. ESG Metric Definition

### 2.1 Anchors
The ESG metric is computed using two fixed anchors:

| Anchor | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Eval-Time Token Usage** | Total tokens consumed strictly during evaluation execution |
| **Parameter Scale** | Declared model size category (config-defined, not inferred) |

No other signals are used.

### 2.2 Formal Definition
Let:
- `T_eval` = total evaluation-time tokens
- `S_param` = parameter scale multiplier

Then:
$$ ESG_{raw} = T_{eval} \times S_{param} $$

The reported ESG score is a normalized scalar derived from `ESG_raw`, used **only for within-benchmark interpretation**.

### 2.3 Parameter Scale Table

| Parameter Scale | Multiplier |
| :--- | :--- |
| XS | 0.6 |
| S | 0.8 |
| M | 1.0 |
| L | 1.2 |
| XL | 1.4 |

Parameter scale is **explicitly declared in config**, never inferred post hoc.

## 3. Measurement Boundaries

### 3.1 Included
- Tokens generated by the model **during evaluation**
- Tokens produced across **all tasks and retries**
- Tokens from **static + runtime phases**

### 3.2 Explicitly Excluded
- Prompt tokens
- System tokens
- Training tokens
- Fine-tuning or adaptation costs
- Infrastructure idle time
- Human annotation or review effort

## 4. Orthogonality Guarantee

The ESG metric is **not used** in:
- Task scoring
- Failure classification
- Difficulty weighting
- Ranking or leaderboard computation

Conversely:
- Task correctness **does not influence** ESG score
- Higher-quality outputs may have **higher or lower ESG**

This enforces **strict orthogonality** between *performance* and *sustainability cost*.

---

## 5. Determinism & Reproducibility

This ESG report is **fully reproducible** under the following conditions:
- Same model identifier
- Same parameterScale
- Same task set and seed
- Same evaluation pipeline version

No stochastic post-processing is applied.

---

## 6. Anti-Gaming Constraints

To prevent manipulation:
- Token counts are measured **at runtime**
- No verbosity normalization is applied
- No post-hoc score smoothing is permitted
- Parameter scale cannot be overridden per task

Violations invalidate ESG comparability.

---

## 7. Non-Comparability Clause

⚠️ **Important Notice**

This ESG score is:
- Comparable **only within the same benchmark**
- Not directly comparable across different evaluation frameworks
- Not a proxy for training carbon footprint
- Not a universal sustainability score

Any cross-benchmark comparison requires re-anchoring.

## 9. Governance & Accountability

- Metric definition is versioned
- Anchors are fixed and documented
- All assumptions are explicitly disclosed
- Deviations must be reported as breaking changes

---

## 10. Limitations

- Does not capture training-time emissions
- Does not model hardware efficiency
- Does not reflect geographic energy mix
- Measures cost, not impact

---

## 11. Intended Use

This ESG report is intended for:
- Model evaluation transparency
- Responsible AI benchmarking
- Research disclosure
- Engineering tradeoff analysis

**It is not intended for regulatory carbon accounting.**
